# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for wanting to get involved! Here are some notes to help your experience go more swimmingly.

## Submitting Issues

### Bugs
If you found a bug, please report it in the "Issues" tab using the following template (you can copy and paste!):

```
## Steps to Reproduce
1. [First I did this]
1. [Then I did this]
1. [Also this]

## Expected Results
[This is what I thought was going to happen]

## Actual Results
[But instead, this happened.]

## Notes
[This section is optional, but if you have something else to add, go for it.]
```

### Feature Requests
If you want to request a whole new feature, we'd love to hear it. Please use one of these two copy-and-pasteable markdown templates:

#### User Story
```
As a [type of user/dancer/human: organizer/teacher/dancer/genderqueer leader/etc.],

I want [to be able to do X]

So that [some goal is met]
```

So for example:
As a traveling dancer, I want to know what events will have AMTD wristbands, so that I know if I'll be able to pick one up in person.

#### Feature Proposal
```
## Feature Request
[A short summary of what this should do.]

## Goal
[Why you want this feature -- it will help the developers prioritize this feature, as well as make sure that whatever we do accomplishes what you need.]

## Implementation Details
[More detail about how this should work, *if* you have it. Ex: If you need the site to display data, what pieces of data exactly? Do you have thoughts about the UX? Etc.]
```

## Working on Code

### Branching Workflow
Core committers should create a branch off of master for all non-trivial changes. Eryn, Ashley, and Joey are allowed to merge branches back to master (even their own branches). Only code that is ready for production should be merged back to master, because code may be pushed live at any time without warning.

Everyone else, please fork the repository to do your work. Once your feature is ready to come back, create a pull request. Eryn will review all pull requests. 

### Grabbing Issues
If no one is assigned to an issue, it's up for grabs.

Some issues may be labeled "easier". Grab these if you want to dip a toe in the water before you jump in the deep end.

If an issue is labeled "wait", please do not start development on it. That means we're still discussing the best way to implement it (or if we should at all).

## Team Communication
In addition to Github issues, we have a private Trello board at https://trello.com/b/yGPofIKj/askmeto-dance. If you aren't logged in on an account that has access to the board, that link will be useless to you.
